1. Introduction to Automated Cryptocurrency Trading using Sentiment Analysis
Automated trading, executed using specialized software known as trading bots, is gaining significant popularityâ€”especially on the dynamic and continuously operating cryptocurrency market. In the context of daily-trading strategies, where decisions are made within short timeframes, market sentiment analysis plays a key role.
Sentiment analysis consists of evaluating the emotions and attitudes of market participants as observed in social media, forums, news articles, and other sources.

The cryptocurrency market is largely driven not only by the hard-to-evaluate fundamentals of many projects but also by speculation and collective investor emotions, such as euphoria, fear, or greed.
Well-designed trading bots that integrate both technical and sentiment analysis can provide a major advantage.
